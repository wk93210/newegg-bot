# NeweggBot
Autonomously buy GPUs from Newegg as soon as they become available

This bot is very much still in the early stages, and more than a little rough around the edges.  Expect the occasional hiccups if you decide to use it.

You will require [Node.js 14](https://nodejs.org/en/) to run this.
After installing via git or by downloading the code and extracting it, navigate to the folder where the files are located via powershell(or equivalent console) and run `npm install puppeteer -PUPPETEER_PRODUCT=firefox`.

Once that is finished, create a copy of config_template.json and name it config.json.  Inside you will find the very basic customization options.  
- 'cv2' refers to the three digit code on the back of your credit card.  
- 'refresh_time' refers to the duration to wait in seconds between add-to-cart attempts.  
- 'item_number' refers to Newegg's item number found at the end of the card page URL.  For example, the item number for 'https://www.newegg.com/evga-geforce-rtx-3080-10g-p5-3897-kr/p/N82E16814487518' is N82E16814487518.  This bot can attempt to buy multiple card models at once by including multiple item numbers separated by a comma.  For example, 'N82E16814487518,N82E16814137598'.  Be cautious with this however, as there are no checks in place to ensure that only one card is purchased, so if by chance two cards you're attempting to purchase come in stock at the same time, the bot would attempt to purchase both.    
- 'auto_submit' refers to whether or not you want the bot to complete the checkout process.  Setting it to 'true' will result in the bot completing the purchase, while 'false' will result in it completing all the steps up to but not including finalizing the purchase.  It is mostly intended as a means to test that the bot is working without actually having it buy something.
- 'price_limit' refers to the maximum price that the bot will attempt to purchase a card for

After installation and configuration, the bot can then be run by using `node neweggbot.js`.

At the moment, in the event that a card comes in stock, but goes out of stock before the bot has been able to complete the purchase, it will likely break, and you will need to restart it.  In general, there are very likely to be occasional issues that break the bot and require you to restart it.
